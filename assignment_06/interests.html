            <p>Rows of identical multicolored meals packed neatly in glass containers on TikTok and Instagram may have made meal prep popular, but there’s more to this practice than meets the eye. Planning, prepping, and sometimes cooking several days’ worth of meals ahead of time has a number of proven advantages, from saving you time to helping you get a wider variety of nutrients in your diet.</p>
            <p>Meal prepping is simply the act of preparing a meal or recipe, then portioning it out to create grab-and-go meals for later. If you’ve ever packed up your leftovers from dinner to take with you for lunch the next day, then you’ve already mini-meal prepped! Generally though, meal prepping refers to preparing 3-7 days worth of food at a time.</p>
            <p>Meal prepping is convenient, efficient, reduces waste, and reduces temptation to eat outside your plan (whether the plan be a diet or a budget). When cooking every single day is out of the question, meal prepping can allow you to still eat home-cooked meals without having to dedicate time each day to preparation.
                And when you eat at home, that means you're not eating out — a practice that, research shows, can have negative health impacts if overindulged. For example, one study suggests that less than 0.1% of restaurant meals were of ideal quality,right up arrow meaning they didn’t have a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, lean poultry, and nuts, nor did they consistently limit sugary drinks, sweets, and processed meats.right up arrow

        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <img class="container-img" alt="Meals prepped for week" src="https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/5aa7f1636ed79626bc262b97/1:1/w_3024,h_3024,c_limit/healthyish-micahmealprep2.jpg">

        <p>As previously noted, home-cooked meals (at least those that are prepped with nutritious ingredients) are generally healthier than takeout, but there’s more: Meal planning is scientifically linked to a more diverse, higher-quality diet, which means it provides nutrients that you likely wouldn’t get otherwise. One study found that individuals who plan their meals are more likely to have better adherence to nutritional guidelines as well as increased food variety.right up arrow “This may be because planning for meals includes a longer thought process, allowing for educated choices,” says Mia Syn, RD, owner of Nutrition by Mia in Charleston, South Carolina. 
            Research also suggests that more time spent on food preparation (over one hour a day) is linked to an increased intake of vegetables, salads, and fruits.right up arrow And it may help you feel nourished but not overstuffed. “Planning ahead enables you to utilize different ingredients and create a more balanced plate, which leaves you feeling satisfied and satiated,” explains Brittany Modell, RD, owner of Brittany Modell Nutrition and Wellness in New York City.</p>
        <p>Research shows that less than one hour per day spent on food preparation at home is linked with significantly more money spent on takeout. Plus, meal prepping can help you save money on groceries because it forces you to be more intentional with your choices and your hard-earned cash.right up arrow
            “Having a plan allows you to figure out exactly what ingredients you will need for the week so you can use them,” says Modell. It’s great for budgeting in general, especially if you take into account ingredients you already have on hand. “Purchasing just what you need can help prevent food waste and ultimately save you money from random purchases that may otherwise go uneaten,” adds Syn.</p>

        <h2>Cooking Basics</h2> 
        <img class= "container-img" alt="Man cooking" src="https://assets.bonappetit.com/photos/5f3bffa3b62c45d85d5245df/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Stop-Cooking-Like-a-Chef-Meherwan-Irani.jpg">
    
        <p>Most recipes require at least a little slicing and dicing. If you're nervous about using kitchen knives (or get daunted watching chefs perfectly chop a butternut squash in 10 seconds flat), don't worry. With a little practice, anyone can master good cutting techniques. 
            The first trick is to learn the proper way to hold a chef's knife. These are the long, heavy knives that are the MVPs of the kitchen. To hold a chef’s knife properly, wrap your middle, ring and pinky finger around the handle, and pinch the top edge of the blade between your thumb and forefinger. This will give you a lot of control, especially when you’re chopping tough-to-cut items like hard squashes or meat.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, certain cooking techniques and tricks can make roasting even simpler and more delicious. For instance, roasting a chicken can take a few hours—but if you butterfly or spatchcock the chicken first (i.e. make a few cuts and flatten it), you’ll reduce the cooking time and still end up with a juicy, flavorful bird. Learn how to roast a spatchcocked chicken using this simple technique. Love roasted veggies? You can get better results with a few key moves: Get tips on how to roast any vegetable, including faster-cooking ones like asparagus and zucchini, medium ones like broccoli and eggplant, and slower ones like potatoes and beets. If you want to perfect your squash game, find out how to peel, cut and roast butternut squash. No matter what vegetable you’re roasting, you'll be able to tell when it's ready by sticking a knife into the center of a piece. If the knife goes in easily and the edges of the vegetable are a nice golden brown, it’s done.</p>
