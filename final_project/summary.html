        <h2>Project Topic and Purpose</h2>

        <p class="body">
            My website serves as a comprehensive portfolio showcasing my diverse range of professional experiences and honed skills. Its purpose is to offer a visual representation of my capabilities to recruiters and other professionals engaged in the recruitment process. My resume, on its own, doesn't effectively convey the connection behind the roles I'm applying for, particularly because they're not closely aligned with my predominant experiences in design and marketing. I think the personal website can help make the connection clearer and highlight the bigger-picture skills I've developed by pivoting in different fields within my undergrad. My work experience isn't linear as I've transitioned from marketing to powerlifting and then most recently, I'm learning to code and design. Additionally, I'm interested in strategy/business development roles. I also think my website allows me to share some personality and pictures that better give context than a resume traditionally does. As this course concludes, my intention is to revisit and further build on top of this portfolio by adding detailed examples of the projects I've done. Creating this portfolio for the final project pushed me to start developing my personal website, which also allowed me to apply both my coding and Figma design skills I learned during this semester.

        <h2>Extras Used Description</h2>

        <p class="body">
            In building my website, I incorporated two additional elements: iFrames and forms. Utilizing an iFrame, I embedded a PDF displaying the latest version of my resume directly onto the site. This feature allows visitors to access a comprehensive overview of my professional experiences on a separate page, if they were interested in learning more after seeing my homepage. Furthermore, I designed a form for the contact section, specifically for individuals visiting my website via platforms like LinkedIn, where my email and phone number aren't readily available. While this information is present on my resume, the contact form streamlines the process, enabling visitors to easily initiate professional connections rather than navigating through the resume, hunting for contact details, and then switching to their email application to reach out.
